# Query Store [Deprecated] :warning:

A UI-Interface built in Angular for selectively issuing SQL queries to multiple deployment environments. This tool consumes some apis that you may have to write as your own. You don't have to use this package if you are using NoSQL.

_Good docs will be provided when it enters beta_

## Please avoid using SQL DBs. They're done

When comes to modern workflows like CI/CD etc., SQL DBS is a pain.

> I'm working on this package against my will. I'm in such a situation. I don't want to waste my precious time on this crap (neither should you) hence I payed little attention to styles. Most of the issues this tool gonna address had already solved by NoSQL's Dynamic Schema feature.

This is an escape hatch. If you've an option, use a DB that supports Dynamic Schema and thus **please avoid using this package**.

> SQL is invented in 70s, It's time to [upgrade](https://www.mongodb.com/).
